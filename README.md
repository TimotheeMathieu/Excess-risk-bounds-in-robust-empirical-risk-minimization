# Excess-risk-bounds-in-robust-empirical-risk-minimization

Code of robust classification and robust regression. 
This code is an illustration of the methods described in the article "Excess risk bounds in robust empirical risk minimization".

A simplified but maybe more stable version of this algorithm has  been implemented as part of scikit-learn-extra python package (see [Here](https://scikit-learn-extra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/robust.html)).
